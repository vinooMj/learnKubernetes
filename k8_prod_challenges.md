Running a production grade Kubernetes environment can be challenging.

I made a quick overview of how a typical Kubernetes Prod looks like 👇

𝟭. 𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗿 𝗢𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 with sophisticated management capabilities including scheduling, service discovery, load balancing, lifecycle management, rolling updates, rollbacks, and scaling

𝟮. 𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗦𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 with cluster auto-scaling and pod autoscaling

𝟯. 𝗟𝗼𝗮𝗱 𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 with advanced routing, service mesh, and Ingress

𝟰. 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 with DNS-based and API-based approaches

𝟱. 𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗢𝗯𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 with monitoring, logging, and distributed tracing

𝟲. 𝗥𝗼𝗯𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗠𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 with:
- TLS Encryption
- Security Policies 
- Secrets Management
- Container Runtime Security
- Image Vulnerability Scanning
- RBAC and Fine-grained Permissions
- Network Segmentation and Isolation

𝟳. 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗗𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀:
- GitOps Practices
- CI/CD Integration
- Deployment Strategies (rolling updates, blue-green deployments, canary deployments etc.,)

𝟴. 𝗛𝗶𝗴𝗵 𝗔𝘃𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗙𝗮𝘂𝗹𝘁 𝗧𝗼𝗹𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 with:
- Persistent Storage 
- Self-healing mechanisms 
- Automatic Pod Rescheduling
- Disaster Recovery Procedures
- Multi-region Cluster Deployment
- Replication controllers and replica sets

Kubernetes is deep and complex and this is just a tip of the iceberg.
